DESTROY IMPORTED DATA - DANGEROUS OPERATION

This script will PERMANENTLY DELETE all data created by the Google Keep importer:
- "Keep Notes Import" folder and ALL its contents
- "Google Keep Notes" spreadsheet
- "Note_Images" folder and ALL uploaded images

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This operation is IRREVERSIBLE and will delete ALL imported notes and images.
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This will NOT affect your original Google Keep data, only the imported copies.
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Make sure you have backups if you need the imported data.

Usage:
    python keep/wipe.py <google-drive-folder-id> [--wipe hard]
    
    --wipe hard: Delete the entire sheet and folder (default behavior)
    --wipe soft: Clear only the tabs, keeping the sheet for revision history

Example:
    python keep/wipe.py 1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms --wipe soft
