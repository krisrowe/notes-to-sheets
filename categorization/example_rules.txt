Categorize notes based on the following rules:

1. Personal notes (family, friends, personal thoughts, diary entries) should be labeled "Personal"
2. Work-related notes (meetings, projects, tasks, deadlines) should be labeled "Work"
3. Shopping lists and purchase-related notes should be labeled "Shopping"
4. Health and fitness notes (workouts, medical appointments, diet) should be labeled "Health"
5. Travel notes (trips, itineraries, bookings) should be labeled "Travel"
6. Learning and educational content (courses, tutorials, research) should be labeled "Education"
7. Financial notes (budgets, expenses, investments) should be labeled "Finance"
8. Recipe and cooking notes should be labeled "Recipes"
9. Technical notes (code snippets, configurations, troubleshooting) should be labeled "Technical"
10. Ideas and creative content should be labeled "Ideas"

If a note fits multiple categories, include all relevant labels separated by commas.
If a note doesn't clearly fit any category, label it as "Miscellaneous".
